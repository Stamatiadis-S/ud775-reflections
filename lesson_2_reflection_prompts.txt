What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A hidden .git folder is created where all of the data needed for git to
    work is stored. It is required because that way git can start tracking
    files and saving commits on demand.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Some files don't need to be tracked but exist in the working directory.
    In the staging area one can specify which files are to be changed in
    each commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    Use the "git diff --staged" to see the staged changes about to be
    committed or use the "git diff" command to see the changes in your working
    directory and then use "git add <file1, file2, etc..>" to stage them. Each
    time make sure the changes you add to the staging area to be logically
    separated. In case you want to un-stage a file, use the "git reset <file>"
    command. Use "git reset <file> --hard" to un-stage the file and also
    discard any changes you made.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    Adding new features or tweaking existing parts of the code are very good
    reasons to use branches. Branches help programmers to work and test on
    different versions of the project simultaneously without polluting the
    main branch. Later on, different branches can be merged to main(master)
    or other branches.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?



What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?



What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
