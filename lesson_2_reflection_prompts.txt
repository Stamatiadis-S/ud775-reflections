What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A hidden .git folder is created where all of the data needed for git to
    work is stored. It is required because that way git can start tracking
    files and saving commits on demand.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Some files don't need to be tracked but exist in the working directory.
    In the staging area one can specify which files are to be changed in
    each commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
